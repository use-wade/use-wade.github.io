          A detailed account of a teams plan to develop the primary feature of their app by prioritizing tasks, dividing responsibilities, and establishing clear lines of communication. The goal is to deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of users by the end of week 12.

<p>The team started by breaking down the development process into smaller, manageable tasks. To ensure everyone was on the same page, they created a comprehensive to-do list, ranking each item based on its importance and complexity. This helped the team to focus their efforts on the most critical tasks and avoid any unnecessary distractions.</p>
<p>Once the team had agreed on the features that the MVP should contain, they distributed the workload based on the ownership defined in a previous meeting. This allowed each team member to take responsibility for specific areas of the project and helped to ensure that everyone was working efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team established clear lines of communication to ensure that everyone was aware of any updates or changes to the project. They also made sure to regularly check in with each other to ensure that everyone was on track and had the support they needed to complete their tasks.</p>
<p>As a brief summary, the team set out to accomplish the main feature of their app by the end of Week 12, which was defined as the ability to view images and additional information gathered from the semantic web about them.</p>
