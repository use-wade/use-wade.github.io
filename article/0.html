          At the end of the first week we had our first meeting to discuss what project should our team pick. After discussing every proposed project, with the help of an anonymous point-based system, we decided that the project unsplash semantic api (use) its the right fit for us.

<p>After completing the course and labs, we had our first meeting to discuss which project our team should pick. We had a number of different options to choose from, and each of us had our own preferences and ideas.</p>
<p>To help us make a decision, we used an anonymous point-based system, where each team member could assign points to the different projects based on their preferences. This allowed us to take everyoneâ€™s opinions into account and to come to a fair and unbiased decision.</p>
<p>After discussing all of the proposed projects, we decided that the project unsplash semantic API (USE) was the right fit for us. This project aligned well with our skills and interests, and we were confident that we would be able to make a valuable contribution to it.</p>
<p>With our project selected, we were ready to begin the next phase of the project, where we would start working on the actual implementation of our application. We were excited to get started, and we were looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.</p>
