<p>Once the team had completed the core functionality of the app, they turned their attention to developing additional features that would enhance the user experience. These features, while not essential to the basic functioning of the app, would add value to the final product.</p>
<p>One of these features was the ability to search through a vast collection of images using either a master keyword or more granular criteria such as country or city. The team recognized the importance of being able to quickly and easily locate specific images, and so they put a great deal of effort into ensuring that the search functionality was fast, reliable, and intuitive to use.</p>
<p>In the end, the team was able to deliver a robust search function that made it easy for users to find the images they were looking for. With this feature in place, the app was well on its way to becoming a complete and fully functional product that would meet the needs of its users.</p>
