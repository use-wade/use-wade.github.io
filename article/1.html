<p>The next two weeks were dedicated to getting a better understanding of the problem that we were trying to solve. In order to do this, we participated in the course and labs, where we learned about RDF and SPARQL and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>Our goal was to get familiar with these technologies at a high level, so that we could use them effectively in our application. We spent a lot of time learning about the different components of RDF and SPARQL, and how they can be used to represent and query data.</p>
<p>In addition to learning about these technologies, we also spent time working on practical exercises and projects that allowed us to apply what we had learned in a real-world setting. This helped us to better understand the challenges and opportunities that come with using RDF and SPARQL, and to develop the skills and expertise we would need to use them effectively in our application.</p>
<p>Overall, the next two weeks were an important part of our learning process, and we were grateful for the opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the problem we were trying to solve. With our new knowledge and skills, we were well-equipped to tackle the next phase of the project.</p>
