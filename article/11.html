<p>The excitement in our team was palpable this week as we finally made our app available to the public. Our dear Marius was the driving force behind this momentous occasion, as he was in charge of deploying the app on cloud servers.</p>
<p>This was a moment that we had all been working towards for months, and it was truly a thrill to see our hard work finally come to fruition. As we enter the final stretch of this project, we are filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>
<p>And so, as we approach the final week before delivering our project, it is with mixed emotions that we write this final article for our application development blog. We want to take this opportunity to thank you, our readers, for following along on this journey with us. Your support and engagement have meant the world to us, and we hope that we have been able to provide you with some valuable insights into the development process.</p>
<p>We look forward to presenting our final product at the upcoming presentation and sharing the fruit of our labors with you. Until then, farewell, and we hope to see you soon!</p>
