<p>As we progressed with the development of our app, we came to a realization that to truly provide an optimal user experience, we needed to consider other, non-core features as well. The idea of user-defined collections immediately caught our attention as it would greatly enhance the overall functionality of the app.</p>
<p>With this new feature in mind, we embarked on a journey to integrate it into our app, which involved making updates and modifications to various parts of the application. This required us to take a comprehensive approach to development, ensuring that every aspect of the app was optimized to work seamlessly with the new addition.</p>
<p>The implementation of user-defined collections required us to delve into the intricacies of our codebase and make the necessary updates. This was no small feat, but our team was up for the challenge. Through hard work, dedication, and collaboration, we were able to make it a reality.</p>
