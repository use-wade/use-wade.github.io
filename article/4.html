<p>After completing the first draft of each of their corresponding tasks, each team member began the process of revising and improving their work. This involved carefully reviewing their deliverables and making any necessary changes to ensure that they met the necessary standards and were consistent with the overall project goals.</p>
<p>In order to keep the project on schedule, we had to be disciplined and focused in our work. This meant that each team member had to stick to the schedule that we had outlined in week 6, and make sure that they completed their revisions and improvements in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Overall, our efforts to stay on schedule paid off, and we were able to complete our revisions and improvements on time. This allowed us to move on to the next phase of the project with confidence, knowing that we had done our best to produce high-quality deliverables that would help us achieve our goals.</p>
